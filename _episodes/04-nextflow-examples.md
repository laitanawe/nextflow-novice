questions:
- "What are the main sections of a Nextflow process?"
- "What are the main components of a Nextflow pipeline?"
- "How do I run a Nextflow pipeline?"

objectives:
- "Explain the benefits of using Nextflow to develop pipelines."
- "Explain the components of a Nextflow process, pipeline."
- "Run a Nextflow pipeline."
keypoints:
- "A workflow is a sequence of tasks that process a set of data."
- "Nextflow scripts comprise of channels for controlling inputs and outputs, and processes for defining workflow tasks."
- "You run Nextflow modules and pipelines using the `nextflow run` command."

## Our example script

We are now going to look at sample Nextflow scripts.
NOTE: In order to run a Nextflow DSL2 script, it must have a workflow section.

~~~
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

/* Contributors:
 * - Awe, O.I
 */

nextflow.enable.dsl=2

/*
 * Default pipeline parameters can be overriden on the command line eg.
 * given 'params.foo' specify on the run command line '--foo some_value'
 */

 params.readpattern = "${baseDir}/data/ggal/*_1.fq"
 params.reads = Channel.fromPath( params.readpattern )
 params.concatout = "concatenated_fwd.txt"
 params.twentyout = "first_twenty_fwd.txt"

 process newconcat {

 echo true

 input:
 path(myreads)

 script:
 """
 cat ${myreads} > ${params.concatout}
 head -20 ${params.concatout} > ${params.twentyout}
 """

 }

 workflow {
 ch_in = params.reads

 newconcat(ch_in)
 }

#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

nextflow.enable.dsl=2

/*

 params.ch1 = Channel.from( 1,2,3 )
 params.ch2 = Channel.from( '1','b','c' )
 params.twentyout = "first_twenty_fwd.txt"

 process twoinputs {

 echo true

 input:
 val x
 val y

 script:
 """
 echo ${x} and ${y}
 """
 }

workflow {
ch1 = params.ch1
ch2 = params.ch2

twoinputs(ch1, ch2)
}

To run a Nextflow script use the command `nextflow run <script_name>`.

> ## Run a Nextflow  script
> Run the script (ex623.nf) by entering the following command(s) in your terminal:
>
> ~~~
> $ nextflow run ex623.nf -process.echo
> $ nextflow run ex623.nf --readpattern 'data/ggal/*_2.fq' --concatout 'concatenated_rev.txt' --twentyout 'first_twenty_rev.txt' -process.echo

> ## Process identification
> The hexadecimal numbers, like 61/1f3ef4, identify the unique process execution.
> These numbers are also the prefix of the directories where each process is executed.
