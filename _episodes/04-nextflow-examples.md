## Our example script

We are now going to look at sample Nextflow scripts.

~~~
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

/* Contributors:
 * - Awe, O. (laitanawe@gmail.com)
 */

nextflow.enable.dsl=2

/*
 * Default pipeline parameters can be overriden on the command line eg.
 * given 'params.foo' specify on the run command line '--foo some_value'
 */

 process concat {

 params.readpattern = "${baseDir}/data/ggal/*_1.fq"
 params.reads = Channel.fromPath(params.readpattern)
 params.concatout = "concatenated_fwd.txt"
 params.twentyout = "first_twenty_fwd.txt"

 input:
 path(myreads) from params.reads.collect()

 script:
 """
 cat ${myreads} > ${params.concatout}
 head -20 ${params.concatout} > ${params.twentyout}
 """

 }

To run a Nextflow script use the command `nextflow run <script_name>`.

> ## Run a Nextflow  script
> Run the script (ex623.nf) by entering the following command(s) in your terminal:
>
> ~~~
> $ nextflow run ex623.nf -process.echo
> $ nextflow run ex623.nf --readpattern 'data/ggal/*_2.fq' --concatout 'concatenated_rev.txt' --twentyout 'first_twenty_rev.txt' -process.echo

> ## Process identification
> The hexadecimal numbers, like 61/1f3ef4, identify the unique process execution.
> These numbers are also the prefix of the directories where each process is executed.
> You can inspect the files produced by changing to the directory `$PWD/work` and
> using these numbers to find the process-specific execution path. We will learn how exactly
> nextflow using *work* directory to execute processes in the following sections.
